# Strings are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. Because they are arrays they can be accessed as thus

# a = "Hello-Janet!"
# print(a[5])  # This should print out '-'


# Looping through a string

# for x in "cherries":
    # print(x)

# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[2:5])  # Here we want to demonstrate slicing. We have specified the start index '2' and the end index '5'.

# Normally we couldn't combine strings and numbers. But python has introduced somethibg called f-string to help

age = 36;
mood = 100;
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age} and my mood is {mood}"
print(txt);

price = 59;
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"  # This acts like a float.
print(txt);
